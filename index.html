            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than the one
                with all the facts.Those who dare to dream often have a broader perspective in life and can turn the
                improbable to the possible. The man behind this profound quote is none other than the genius German
                scientist Albert Einstein. He emphasised the importance of sticking to what you want to do, even when
                others think it’s ‘unrealistic’.</p>
